# Integrating Audio for Aya Vision

## Summary
This project focuses on integrating speech and audio processing capabilities into **Aya Vision**, aiming to enhance its multimodal understanding. The key components include **Speech-to-Text (STT)**, **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**, and **audio-visual fusion** to improve scene comprehension and accessibility.

## Project Scope
The scope of this project is to explore the integration of audio capabilities into Aya Vision, starting with voice-based interaction. The goal is to assess the potential of adding STT and TTS functionalities to enhance accessibility, user interaction, and multimodal AI capabilities.

## Subteams

To organize the project, the following subteams have been defined:

1. **STT/Audio Preprocessing**: Responsible for converting speech to text and maintaining performance in high-fidelity environments.
2. **TTS Aya Vision Integrations**: Focused on integrating speech-to-text capabilities with the Aya Vision model and outputting speech via mobile/web apps.
3. **Model Testing & Benchmarks**: Responsible for creating automated scripts for voice APIs, benchmarking the best STT/TTS models, and developing novel benchmarks for multilingual audio processing.
